<p>
I am currently pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), supervised by Prof. Gerhard Neumann. Simultaneously, I am involved with the FZI Research Center for Information Technology, working towards establishing a new research group under Prof. Neumann's direction.

Before my time at KIT, I worked with the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence and the University of TÃ¼bingen for eight months.
Furthermore, my academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Autonomous Systems (Computer Science) from the Technical University Darmstadt.

I aim to complete my PhD by Spring 2025 and <b>am currently seeking internship opportunities.</b>
